# Request access to the UK Met Office data on CEDA from this web page:
# https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/f47bc62786394626b665e23b658d385f
#
# Then call this script with three arguments: <username> <password> <year>.  e.g.:
# ./download_UK_Met_Office_NWPs_from_CEDA.sh foo bar 2021
#
# Call this script in the directory into which you want to download data.  For
# example, if you want to download data for 2021, create a directory
# called something like /data/2021/, and run this script from that directory.
#
# The Met Office data on CEDA goes back to March 2016.  This script
# will download about 4 terabytes per year of data.
#
# You probably want to run this script in a `gnu screen` session if you're
# SSH'ing into a VM or remote server.

# What are all those `--reject-regex` instructions doing?
#
# --reject-regex "[[:digit:]]{8}(03|09|15|21)00.*\.grib$"
#   rejects all NWPs initialised at 3, 9, 15, or 21 hours (and so you end up
#   with "only" four initialisations per day: 00, 06, 12, 18).
#
# --reject-regex "T120\.grib$"
#   rejects the `T120` files, which contain forecast steps from 2 days and
#   9 hours ahead, to 5 days ahead, in 3-hourly increments.  So we accept the
#   `Wholesale[1234].grib` files (steps from 00:00 to 1 day and 12 hours ahead,
#   in hourly increments) and `Wholesale[1234]T54.grib` files (step runs from
#   1 day and 13 hours ahead to 2 days and 6 hours ahead.  Hourly increments
#   from 1 day and 13 hours ahead to 2 days ahead.  Then 3-hourly increments).
#
# --reject-regex "Wholesale5.*\.grib$"
#   rejects the `Wholesale5` files, which are just static topography data,
#   so no need to download multiple copies of this data!
